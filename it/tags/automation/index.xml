 I have been using AI coding assistants seriously for about a year — not casually, not experimentally, but as a core part of how I do my job every day. This is not a post about AI generating code. It is about how AI changes the way an experienced engineer thinks, investigates, and makes decisions.
&lt;/div>

&lt;p>The naive version of AI-assisted development is: you describe what you want, the AI writes it, you review and move on. This is real and useful, but it is also the least interesting thing AI does for me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building an AI-Powered Platform Operations Agent</title><link>https://manuelfedele.github.io/it/posts/building-ai-powered-platform-operations-agent/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 11:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://manuelfedele.github.io/it/posts/building-ai-powered-platform-operations-agent/</guid><description>&lt;div class="lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl">
 Platform engineering teams handle a constant stream of repetitive requests. This post walks through building an AI agent that automates common platform tasks — user provisioning, key rotation, service health checks — by giving an LLM access to internal tools through a structured tool-calling interface.
&lt;/div>

&lt;p>Platform engineering teams handle a constant stream of repetitive requests: onboarding users, managing API keys, checking service health, rotating credentials. Most of these tasks follow well-defined procedures that a human executes step by step. What if an AI agent could handle them instead?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
