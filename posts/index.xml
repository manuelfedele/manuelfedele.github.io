The keyword &amp;ldquo;yield&amp;rdquo; is a important part of the Python programming language, and it can be used in a number of different ways. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a closer look at what the yield keyword does in Python, and how it can be used to create more efficient and powerful programs.
The primary use of the yield keyword is to create a generator function. A generator function is a special type of function that produces a sequence of values, one at a time, when it is called.</description></item><item><title>Use Protobuf With Golang</title><link>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/use-protobuf-with-golang/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 18:48:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/use-protobuf-with-golang/</guid><description>
Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a language- and platform-neutral data serialization format developed by Google. It allows you to define data structures in a .proto file and then use code generation tools to generate code in various languages for working with those data structures.
To use Protobuf with Go, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to do the following:
Install the Protobuf compiler (protoc) and the Go Protobuf plugin:
# Install protoc wget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.14.0/protoc-3.14.0-linux-x86_64.zip unzip protoc-3.</description></item><item><title>Create Command Line Application With Golang</title><link>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/create-command-line-application-with-golang/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 10:03:30 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/create-command-line-application-with-golang/</guid><description>

In PostgreSQL, the json data type can be used to store JSON data. You can use the -&amp;gt; operator to access elements of a JSON object, and the -&amp;raquo; operator to access values of a JSON object as text.
For example, consider the following table with a JSON field called data:
CREATE TABLE documents ( id serial PRIMARY KEY, data json ); To insert a JSON object into the data field, you can use the json_build_object function:</description></item><item><title>How to Create a Webserver in Golang</title><link>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/how-to-create-a-webserver-in-golang/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2022 19:14:21 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/how-to-create-a-webserver-in-golang/</guid><description>
To create a web server in Go, you can use the http package provided by the standard library. This package includes the http.Server type, which represents an HTTP server, and the http.ListenAndServe() function, which listens for incoming HTTP requests on a specified port and serves responses to those requests.
Here is an example of how you might create a simple web server in Go:
// Import the http package import &amp;#34;net/http&amp;#34; // Define a function that will be called to handle incoming HTTP requests func handler(w http.</description></item><item><title>How to Use Interfaces in Golang</title><link>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/how-to-use-interfaces-in-golang/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2022 19:04:27 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/how-to-use-interfaces-in-golang/</guid><description>
In Go, an interface is a type that defines a set of methods that a struct must implement in order to implement the interface. An interface defines the behavior or capabilities of a struct without specifying the implementation details. This allows different structs to implement the same interface in different ways, promoting loose coupling and flexibility in your code.
Here is an example of an interface in Go:
// Define an interface named Animal type Animal interface { // Define a method named Speak that takes no arguments and returns a string Speak() string } In this example, the Animal interface defines a single method named Speak(), which takes no arguments and returns a string.</description></item><item><title>Implement Factory Design Pattern in Golang</title><link>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/implement-factory-design-pattern-golang/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2022 18:57:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/implement-factory-design-pattern-golang/</guid><description>
To implement the factory design pattern in Go, you can create a factory function that returns an object that implements a common interface. This function can take parameters to specify the type of object to be created. Here is an example of how you might implement the factory design pattern in Go:
// Define an interface that the factory will create objects for type Animal interface { Speak() string } // Define a factory function that returns an object that implements the Animal interface func NewAnimal(animalType string) Animal { switch animalType { case &amp;#34;dog&amp;#34;: return &amp;amp;Dog{} case &amp;#34;cat&amp;#34;: return &amp;amp;Cat{} default: return nil } } // Define a struct for a dog that implements the Animal interface type Dog struct{} func (d *Dog) Speak() string { return &amp;#34;Woof!</description></item><item><title>Create a template for Hugo</title><link>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/create-template-hugo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 14:57:41 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/create-template-hugo/</guid><description>
Introduction # This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content.

We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description></item><item><title>Poetry No Module Seed via App Data</title><link>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/poetry-no-module-seed-via-app-data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 15:15:47 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/poetry-no-module-seed-via-app-data/</guid><description>
For my last project, I used poetry to manage dependencies and package my code. Poetry comes with all the tools you might need to manage your projects in a deterministic way.
Anyway, after running poetry init in an existing project, I tried to let poetry create a virtuale environment, by adding the first dependecy, but when I did poetry add twisted it suddenly hang out, printing:
No module named &amp;#39;virtualenv.seed.via_app_data&amp;#39; Why is that?</description></item><item><title>Amazon Echo Plus as bluetooth speaker on Ubuntu 20.04</title><link>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/ubuntu-echo-plus-alexa-workaround-bluetooth-speaker/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2020 09:37:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/ubuntu-echo-plus-alexa-workaround-bluetooth-speaker/</guid><description>
