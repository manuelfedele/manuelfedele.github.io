The goal of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the application is working as intended and meets the specified requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Go, the testing package provides support for writing unit tests. To write unit tests, you need to create a file with a name that ends in _test.go and place it in the same package as the code you want to test. The testing package also provides a testing.T type that represents a testing context and has methods for reporting test failures and logging messages.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
