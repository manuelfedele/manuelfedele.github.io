 Bubbletea brings the Elm architecture to the terminal, making it possible to build rich, interactive CLI tools in Go with clean state management. This post covers the fundamentals with a practical example.
&lt;/div>

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever wanted to build a terminal application that feels more like a proper UI than a wall of text, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">charmbracelet&lt;/a> ecosystem is the way to go. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it to build internal DevOps tools, and the developer experience is excellent. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk through building an interactive CLI tool using &lt;a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bubbletea&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Huh&lt;/a>, the same libraries behind tools like &lt;code>gum&lt;/code> and &lt;code>soft-serve&lt;/code>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Create Command Line Application With Golang</title><link>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/create-command-line-application-with-golang/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 10:03:30 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/create-command-line-application-with-golang/</guid><description>&lt;div class="lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl">
 If you have a folder with a large number of files and you want to organize them by file extension, you can create a command line application to do this automatically using Go. Go, also known as Golang, is a programming language developed by Google that is designed to be fast,&amp;hellip;

&lt;p>If you have a folder with a large number of files and you want to organize them by file extension, you can create a command line application to do this automatically using Go. Go, also known as Golang, is a programming language developed by Google that is designed to be fast, statically-typed, and easy to learn. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through the steps to create a Go program that separates files in a given folder into subfolders based on their extension.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
