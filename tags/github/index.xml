 Cron triggers in GitHub Actions are powerful for automation that should not need a human to fire it: nightly vulnerability audits, weekly cost checks, certificate expiry alerts. This is the practical guide &amp;ndash; real workflows, real use cases, and the traps to avoid.
&lt;/div>

&lt;p>Most GitHub Actions tutorials cover push and pull request triggers. The &lt;code>schedule&lt;/code> trigger gets less attention, but it is often where the most valuable automation lives. A nightly dependency audit that opens an issue when it finds CVEs. A weekly cost check that alerts Slack when your AWS bill spikes. A certificate check that pages you before the cert expires rather than after. None of these need a developer to press a button.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploying a Static Site with Hugo and GitHub Actions: Zero-Cost Hosting</title><link>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/create-website-with-gatsby-and-github-pages/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 09:49:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/create-website-with-gatsby-and-github-pages/</guid><description>&lt;div class="lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl">
 Static sites are the most cost-efficient way to host content. No servers to maintain, no runtime costs, no scaling surprises. With Hugo and GitHub Actions you get a fast, version-controlled blog deployed automatically on every push, for effectively zero cost.

 &lt;/span>
 
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Gatsby had a good run, but the ecosystem has shifted. The project was acquired, maintenance slowed, and most teams that were using it have migrated to Next.js or a static generator. Hugo fills a different niche: it does not care about React, has no Node.js dependency, and builds thousands of pages in under a second. If you are building a blog or documentation site and not a full React application, Hugo is the right tool.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
