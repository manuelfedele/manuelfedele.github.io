 I have been using AI coding assistants seriously for about a year — not casually, not experimentally, but as a core part of how I do my job every day. This is not a post about AI generating code. It is about how AI changes the way an experienced engineer thinks, investigates, and makes decisions.
&lt;/div>

 &lt;/span>
 
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The naive version of AI-assisted development is: you describe what you want, the AI writes it, you review and move on. This is real and useful, but it is also the least interesting thing AI does for me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building an AI-Powered Platform Operations Agent</title><link>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/building-ai-powered-platform-operations-agent/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 11:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/building-ai-powered-platform-operations-agent/</guid><description>&lt;div class="lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl">
 Platform engineering teams handle a constant stream of repetitive requests. This post walks through building an AI agent that automates common platform tasks — user provisioning, key rotation, service health checks — by giving an LLM access to internal tools through a structured tool-calling interface.
&lt;/div>

&lt;p>Platform engineering teams handle a constant stream of repetitive requests: onboarding users, managing API keys, checking service health, rotating credentials. Most of these tasks follow well-defined procedures that a human executes step by step. What if an AI agent could handle them instead?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scheduled Automation with GitHub Actions: Real DevOps Use Cases</title><link>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/schedule-github-action-with-cron/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 15:03:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/schedule-github-action-with-cron/</guid><description>&lt;div class="lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl">
 Cron triggers in GitHub Actions are powerful for automation that should not need a human to fire it: nightly vulnerability audits, weekly cost checks, certificate expiry alerts. This is the practical guide &amp;ndash; real workflows, real use cases, and the traps to avoid.
&lt;/div>

&lt;p>Most GitHub Actions tutorials cover push and pull request triggers. The &lt;code>schedule&lt;/code> trigger gets less attention, but it is often where the most valuable automation lives. A nightly dependency audit that opens an issue when it finds CVEs. A weekly cost check that alerts Slack when your AWS bill spikes. A certificate check that pages you before the cert expires rather than after. None of these need a developer to press a button.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
