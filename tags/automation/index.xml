Not casually, not experimentally: as a core part of how I do my job every day. I work across a wide surface area, writing Go and Python, managing cloud infrastructure, debugging distributed systems, automating operational workflows. AI has changed how I approach all of it, but not in the ways the marketing copy says.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is not a post about AI generating code. It is about how AI changes the way an experienced engineer thinks, investigates, and makes decisions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building an AI-Powered Platform Operations Agent</title><link>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/building-ai-powered-platform-operations-agent/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 11:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://manuelfedele.github.io/posts/building-ai-powered-platform-operations-agent/</guid><description>&lt;h1 class="relative group">Building an AI-Powered Platform Operations Agent

&lt;p>Platform engineering teams handle a constant stream of repetitive requests: onboarding users, managing API keys, checking service health, rotating credentials. Most of these tasks follow well-defined procedures that a human executes step by step. What if an AI agent could handle them instead?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk through the architecture of an AI-powered operations agent that automates common platform tasks by giving an LLM access to your internal tools through a structured tool-calling interface.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
