      <description>To delete a Git branch locally, you can use the git branch command with the -d flag, followed by the name of the branch you want to delete. For example:
git branch -d branch_name This will delete the specified branch if it has already been fully merged into the current branch. If the branch has not been fully merged, you can use the -D flag instead, which will force the deletion of the branch.</description>

While these two commands may seem similar at first glance, they have some important differences that are worth understanding.
The git pull command is a combination of git fetch and git merge.</description>
